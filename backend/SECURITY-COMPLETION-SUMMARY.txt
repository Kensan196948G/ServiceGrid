- ‚úÖ Enhanced existing error handlers and validation

üîß SECURITY FEATURES ENABLED:
- JWT authentication with 1-hour expiration
- Role hierarchy: readonly < user < operator < administrator
- Rate limiting: 10/15min (auth), 1000/15min (API), 5/hour (critical)
- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout
- Request size limit: 10MB maximum
- PowerShell timeout: 30 seconds maximum
- Output sanitization: Sensitive data redacted

üöÄ READY FOR PRODUCTION:
- All security middleware integrated
- Comprehensive test suite available
- Performance optimized with connection pooling
- Audit logging for compliance
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling

‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION CHECKLIST:
1. Set strong JWT_SECRET in environment
2. Configure HTTPS with SSL certificates
3. Set up log rotation and monitoring
4. Review and adjust rate limits for production load
5. Configure backup and disaster recovery
6. Set up security monitoring alerts

The ServiceGrid ITSM backend now has enterprise-grade security
with comprehensive protection against common threats and attacks.
